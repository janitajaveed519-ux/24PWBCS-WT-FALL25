During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control.  
I practiced creating and deleting files, writing commit messages, and pushing changes to GitHub.  
I also explored working with branches, merging them, and resolving potential conflicts.  
This experience improved my confidence in managing projects with Git.  
Overall, I now understand how Git helps in tracking history and collaborating on code.
